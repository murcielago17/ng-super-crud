Create an Angular app which uses the end points available on <a href="https://github.com/sf-wdi-24/crud-api" target="_blank">super-crud</a>.

You're required to initialize Angular and use Angular Resource in your solution. Your solution may be submitted as a jsFiddle, html file or any other method you find to host your Angular code.

If your code is an external link, include that URL in your pull request.

**Getting Started**
* Fork this repo, and clone it into your `develop` folder on your local machine.

**Submission**
* As you make code changes, frequently commit and push to GitHub.
* Once you've finished the assignment and pushed your work to GitHub, make a pull request from your fork to the original repo.
